"The Deal"
==========

You get:

- Mentorship from students and professionals with advanced skills in software
  development and systems administration
- Professional connections in the software industry
- A welcoming environment to start learning in if you've always wanted to
  learn about software development and systems administration but have never been
  sure where to start
- An opportunity to fill in any gaps in your knowledge if you're a
  self-taught coder or sysadmin
- The skills to build and deploy open source software or to contribute to
  existing projects

Why we're offering this:

- To help you succeed in your careers 
- To improve the reputation of WWU and quality of its graduates 
- The open source community gets more contributors to its projects

Attendance
==========

We will schedule BootCamp meetings for a time that works for a majority of
attendees. Each meeting's curriculum will build on what you learned the
previous session, so if you miss a meeting you're responsible for studying
the basics of its content on your own. To facilitate this, we will provide
resources for independent study about each topic that we cover.

BootCamp leaders will be available at times outside of the regular meetings to
help answer any questions about the training program's content. We will not
spend class time reviewing material for those who skip a lecture. If you
attend a lesson and don't understand something from it, you're welcome to ask
in class, because others very likely have the same concern. But if you want to
make up a class you skipped, it's disrespectful to those who attended to spend
their class time on questions which you could resolve on your own time.

Target Audience
===============

Our goal is to make the DevOps BootCamp program accessible to students and
community members from all different backgrounds. You have to want to learn,
be willing to ask questions whenever you don't understand something, and
be open to making time to play with the cool tools/toys which we'll be
teaching you about.

Fluency in English is strongly recommended, because it's the language in which
the course will be taught as well as the language of almost all open source
technical documentation and code comments.
