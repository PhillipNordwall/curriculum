FAQ

Email questions to wwudevops@gmail.com if they aren't answered here!

Is this a for-credit class?
---------------------------

No, although the skills gained here will help immensely with the rest of
your coursework.

What does it cost?
------------------

Financially, it's free. However, to benefit from the hands-on learning
opportunities that we'll be offering, you should plan to commit 5 or more
hours per week to attending lectures and playing with the tools and
technologies that the lectures will discuss.

I don't know about computers! Can I still join?
-----------------------------------------------

YES! If you already knew all this stuff, you'd be teaching rather than studying
it. If you think you don't know enough, try anyway -- in the worst case you'll
discover that your self-assessment was correct, and in the best case you'll
become a successful open source contributor.

When will meetings be?
----------------------

Meetings are to be determined.

Is this only for students?
--------------------------

Yes, at this time we are only able to provide this service to WWU students
although we would like to expand to the community eventually.

I wasn't able to participate during Fall term. Can I still join?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes! Please read through lessons 1-3 (linked from the curriculum page) and 
ask in Slack if you have trouble following the instructions for them. Catch up
on that content and you'll be ready to join in Winter term. 

I have a question?
------------------

Ask it on Slack in ``#devops``, or email wwudevops@gmail.com.
