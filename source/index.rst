DevOps BootCamp
===============

WWU DevOps BootCamp is an adaptation of an OSU Open Source Lab and OSU Linux Users Group program
that aims to boost our impact and outreach while shrinking the skills gap for
OSU students interested in DevOps.

This program is based on the `PSU Braindump <http://braindump.cat.pdx.edu>`_,
where for 21 years they have been turning PSU students into sysadmins who have
rapidly been flowing into the growing number of startups in Portland.

The DevOps BootCamp program will be dynamically shaping itself based on the
feedback we get from  interested students.
